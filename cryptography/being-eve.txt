===== DIFFIE-HELLMAN =====

Alice's random number is 41 and Bob's is 23. Both Alice and Bob used their random
number r to compute the number they sent to each other with the equation g^r mod p,
given g = 7 and p = 61. So for Alice, 7^r mod 61 = 30 and for Bob 7^r mod 61 = 17.
I wrote a short Python script "cryptography/d-h.py" to count up from 0 until it hit 
a solution for r that satisfied the values Alice and Bob sent to each other. Since
this is a brute-force strategy for finding the random numbers, this script would 
fail for larger numbers.

The secret key agreed upon by Alice and Bob is thus 6. The equation for the secret 
key is g^(ab) mod p, where a and b are Alice and Bob's random numbers. So the 
equation would be 7^(41*23) mod 61, which comes out to 6.

===== RSA =====

For n = 170171, p = 379 and q = 449. I found these values by writing a Python loop in
"rsa.py" that goes through all the digits from 2 to 170171 until it finds its prime
factors. Using these values for p and q, and e = 17, I wrote another loop that tries 
every possible value for d in the equation ed = 1 mod (p-1)(q-1) until it finds a 
solution. Thus I found that d = 119537 satisfies the equation. The first loop could be
more efficient by only looping through prime numbers, but the second loop is where 
this process would fail, since with a large modulus trying to find d would take too
long.
