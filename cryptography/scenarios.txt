1. Alice and Bob should agree on a secret key using Diffie-Hellman and subsequently
Alice can send her message to Bob using the key with AES. AES is faster than public
key encryption, and Diffie-Hellman is only susceptible to AITM attacks.

2. Alice and Bob should agree on a secret key using Diffie-Hellman. When Alice sends
her message M she should concatenate a digital signature that is E(S_A, H(M)) onto
the end of the message. Bob can then verify whether the message has been modified by
decrypting H(M) with P_A and checking whether H(M) corresponds to the hash of the
message Bob received.
