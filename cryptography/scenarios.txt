1. Alice and Bob should agree on a secret key using Diffie-Hellman and subsequently
Alice can send her message to Bob using the key with AES. AES is faster than public
key encryption, and Diffie-Hellman is only susceptible to AITM attacks.

2. Alice and Bob should agree on a secret key using Diffie-Hellman. When Alice sends
her message M she should concatenate a digital signature that is E(S_A, H(M)) onto
the end of the message. Bob can then verify whether the message has been modified by
decrypting H(M) with P_A and checking whether H(M) corresponds to the hash of the
message Bob received.

3. Alice and Bob should agree on a secret key using Diffie-Hellman. When Alice sends
her message M she should concatenate a digital signature E(S_A, H(M)) onto the end of
the message. Alice should then encrypt the message and digital signature with AES 
using the D-H key. Bob can then verify that the message was sent by Alice by 
decrypting the message with the D-H key, decrypting the signature with Alice's P_A,
and comparing H(M) with the hash of the message Bob received to make sure that only
Alice could have sent the message since she would need to know both her private key
and the D-H key.

4.  - Alice could say Bob has the wrong public key and that someone else impersonated
	her to send a false contract. I would find this quite plausible as the judge if 
	Alice could prove that her public key is different than the one Bob presents.
	- Alice could say that someone else has access to her private key and signed the
	contract. I would find this fairly plausible as the judge, but it would be 
	difficult to prove that the private key had been compromised.
	- Alice could say there was an AITM attack. As the judge I would not believe this,
	because creating digital signatures with public/private key pairs is not susceptible
	to AITM attacks.
