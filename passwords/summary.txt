Analysis:
- Did your time per hash computed change between phases? By what factor? Why?
- Did your time per password crack change between phases? By what factor? Why?
- Suppose you wanted to precompute all the hashes for each possible password
so you could just look up the password in a table indexed by the hash. How much
memory would be required for each phase?
- Give 3-4 reasons we should store password hashes and not the passwords themselves.
Think in terms of threats, who the attackers might be, etc.
