===== COOKIES =====
a. There is one cookie named theme with a value of default.

b. The theme cookie changed its value to blue.

c. When first visiting the page, the cookie HTTP header says theme=default. When changing
	the theme, the cookie header remains theme=default until there is a GET request for
	theme=blue, and at that point the cookie header changes to theme=blue. This is the 
	same value as in the inspector.

d. The blue theme is still selected.

e. There is an HTTP cookie header of theme=value when sending a GET request to the 
	FDF server, depending on the value of the cookie.

f. The browser sends a GET request to the server to fetch theme=changedvalue and the
	server sends back the changed page depending on the new cookie value.

g. In the Inspector go to application, then cookies, and select cs338.jeffondich.com. 
	Then select the theme cookie, and right click to edit the value. Put in the value,
	hit enter, and refresh the page.

h. You can intercept and change the GET request to have the modified theme value that
	you want in the request. So instead of GET /fdf/?theme=default HTTP/1.1, you could
	have it be theme=default and the server will load the blue theme.

i. On my Windows machine, Google Chrome stores the cookies under 
	C:\Users\arian\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Network in a
	file named Cookies.

===== CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING =====

a. 
Provide a diagram and/or a step-by-step description of the nature and timing of Moriarty's attack on users of the FDF.

b. 
Describe an XSS attack that is more virulent than Moriarty's "turn something red" and "pop up a message" attacks. Think about what kinds of things the Javascript might have access to via Alice's browser when Alice views the attacker's post.

c. 
Do it again: describe a second attack that is more virulent than Moriarty's, but that's substantially different from your first idea.

d. 
What techniques can the server or the browser use to prevent what Moriarty is doing?
